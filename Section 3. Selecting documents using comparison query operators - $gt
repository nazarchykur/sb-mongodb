MongoDB $gt


    Summary: 
        in this tutorial, you will learn how to use the MongoDB $gt operator to select documents where the value of a 
        field is greater than a specified value.
    
    
    
    Introduction to the MongoDB $gt operator
        The $gt operator is a comparison query operator that allows you to select documents where the value of a field 
        is greater than (>) a specified value.
        
        The following shows the syntax of the $gt operator:
        
            { field: { $gt: value}}

    
    
    MongoDB $gt operator example
        Weâ€™ll use the following widget collection:
        
        db.products.insertMany([
            { "_id" : 1, "name" : "xPhone", "price" : 799, "releaseDate": ISODate("2011-05-14"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 6.5, "cpu" : 2.66 },"color":["white","black"],"storage":[64,128,256]},
            { "_id" : 2, "name" : "xTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate": ISODate("2011-09-01") , "spec" : { "ram" : 16, "screen" : 9.5, "cpu" : 3.66 },"color":["white","black","purple"],"storage":[128,256,512]},
            { "_id" : 3, "name" : "SmartTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate": ISODate("2015-01-14"), "spec" : { "ram" : 12, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 3.66 },"color":["blue"],"storage":[16,64,128]},
            { "_id" : 4, "name" : "SmartPad", "price" : 699, "releaseDate": ISODate("2020-05-14"),"spec" : { "ram" : 8, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 },"color":["white","orange","gold","gray"],"storage":[128,256,1024]},
            { "_id" : 5, "name" : "SmartPhone", "price" : 599,"releaseDate": ISODate("2022-09-14"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 },"color":["white","orange","gold","gray"],"storage":[128,256]}
         ])



    1) Using $gt to select documents where the value of a field is greater than a specified value
        The following example uses the $gt operator to select documents from the products collection where price is 
        greater than 699:
        
            db.products.find({
                price: {
                    $gt: 699
                }
            }, {
                name: 1,
                price: 1
            })

        The query returned the following documents:
        
            [
              { _id: 1, name: 'xPhone', price: 799 },
              { _id: 2, name: 'xTablet', price: 899 },
              { _id: 3, name: 'SmartTablet', price: 899 }
            ]



    2) Using the $gt operator to check if the value of a field in an embedded document is greater than a value
        The following example uses $gt operator to select documents where the value of the ram field in the spec document is greater than 8:
        
            db.products.find({
                "spec.ram": {
                    $gt: 8
                }
            }, {
                name: 1,
                "spec.ram": 1
            });

        Output:
        
        [
          { _id: 2, name: 'xTablet', spec: { ram: 16 } },
          { _id: 3, name: 'SmartTablet', spec: { ram: 12 } }
        ]



    3) Using the $gt operator to check if an array element is greater than a value
        The following example uses the $gt operator to query the products collection to find all documents where the 
        storage array has at least one element greater than 128:
        
        db.products.find({
            storage: {
                $gt: 128
            }
        }, {
            name: 1,
            storage: 1
        })

        The query returned the following documents:
            
            [
              { _id: 1, name: 'xPhone', storage: [ 64, 128, 256 ] },
              { _id: 2, name: 'xTablet', storage: [ 128, 256, 512 ] },
              { _id: 4, name: 'SmartPad', storage: [ 128, 256, 1024 ] },
              { _id: 5, name: 'SmartPhone', storage: [ 128, 256 ] }
            ]



    4) Using the $gt operator to check if the value of a field is after a date
        The following example uses the $gt operator to query documents from the products collection to find all 
        documents where the release date is after 2015-01-01:
        
            db.products.find({
                "releaseDate": {
                    $gt: new ISODate('2015-01-01')
                }
            }, {
                name: 1,
                releaseDate: 1
            });

        The query returned the following documents:
        
            [
              {
                _id: 3,
                name: 'SmartTablet',
                releaseDate: ISODate("2015-01-14T00:00:00.000Z")
              },
              {
                _id: 4,
                name: 'SmartPad',
                releaseDate: ISODate("2020-05-14T00:00:00.000Z")
              },
              {
                _id: 5,
                name: 'SmartPhone',
                releaseDate: ISODate("2022-09-14T00:00:00.000Z")
              }
            ]


    Summary
        Use the $gt operator to select documents where a field is greater than a specified value.

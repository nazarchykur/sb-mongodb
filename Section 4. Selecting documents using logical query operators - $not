MongoDB $not


    Summary: 
        in this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the MongoDB $not operator to perform a logical NOT operator.
    
    
    
    Introduction to the MongoDB $not operator
        The following shows the syntax of the $not operator:
        
            { field: { $not: { <expression> } } }

        The $not operator is a logical query operator that performs a logical NOT operation on a specified <expression> 
        and selects documents that do not match the <expression>. This includes the documents that do not contain the field.
        
        
        
    MongoDB $not operator examples
        We’ll use the following products collection:
        
        db.products.insertMany([
            { "_id" : 1, "name" : "xPhone", "price" : 799, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2011-05-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 6.5, "cpu" : 2.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "black" ], "storage" : [ 64, 128, 256 ] },
            { "_id" : 2, "name" : "xTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 16, "screen" : 9.5, "cpu" : 3.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "black", "purple" ], "storage" : [ 128, 256, 512 ] },
            { "_id" : 3, "name" : "SmartTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2015-01-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 12, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 3.66 }, "color" : [ "blue" ], "storage" : [ 16, 64, 128 ] },
            { "_id" : 4, "name" : "SmartPad", "price" : 699, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2020-05-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 8, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "orange", "gold", "gray" ], "storage" : [ 128, 256, 1024 ] },
            { "_id" : 5, "name" : "SmartPhone", "price" : 599, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2022-09-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "orange", "gold", "gray" ], "storage" : [ 128, 256 ] },
            { "_id" : 6, "name" : "xWidget", "spec" : { "ram" : 64, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 3.66 }, "color" : [ "black" ], "storage" : [ 1024 ] }
        ])



    1) Using MongoDB $not operator to select documents
        The following example shows how to use the $not operator to find documents where:
            > the price field is not greater than 699.
            > do not contain the price field.
            
            db.products.find({
                price: {
                    $not: {
                        $gt: 699
                    }
                }
            }, {
                name: 1,
                price: 1
            })

        It returned the following documents:
        
            [
              { _id: 4, name: 'SmartPad', price: 699 },
              { _id: 5, name: 'SmartPhone', price: 599 },
              { _id: 6, name: 'xWidget' }
            ]

        Notice that the { $not: { $gt: 699 } } is different from the $lte operator. The { $lte : 699 } returns documents 
        where the price field exists and its value is less than or equal to 699.
        
        The following example uses the $lte operator:
        
            db.products.find({
                price: {
                    $lte: 699
                }
            }, {
                name: 1,
                price: 1
            })

        It returned the following documents:
        
            [
              { _id: 4, name: 'SmartPad', price: 699 },
              { _id: 5, name: 'SmartPhone', price: 599 }
            ]

        As you can see clearly from the output, the result of the query that uses the $lte operator does not include 
        the documents where the price field does not exist.
        
    
    
    2) Using MongoDB $not operator to select documents based on expressions
        The following example uses the $not operator to select documents from the products collection where the value of 
        the field does not match the regular expression /^smart+/i:
        
            db.products.find({
                name: {
                    $not: /^Smart+/
                }
            }, {
                name: 1
            })

        The regular expression /^Smart+/ matches any string that starts with the string smart and is followed by any 
        number of characters.
        
        The query returns the following documents:
        
            [
              { _id: 1, name: 'xPhone' },
              { _id: 2, name: 'xTablet' },
              { _id: 6, name: 'xWidget' }
            ]



    Summary
        Use the MongoDB $not operator to perform a logical NOT operation on a specified <expression> and selects 
        documents that do not match the <expression>.

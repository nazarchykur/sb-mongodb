MongoDB $nor


    Summary: 
        in this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the MongoDB $nor operator to perform a logical NOR operator.
    
    
    
    Introduction to the MongoDB $nor operator
        The $nor is a logical query operator that allows you to perform a logical NOR operation on a list of one or more 
        query expressions and selects documents that fail all the query expressions.
        
        The syntax of the $nor operator is as follows:
        
         { $nor: [ { <expression1> }, { <expression2> },...] }

        We’ll use the following products collection:
        
        db.products.insertMany([
            { "_id" : 1, "name" : "xPhone", "price" : 799, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2011-05-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 6.5, "cpu" : 2.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "black" ], "storage" : [ 64, 128, 256 ] },
            { "_id" : 2, "name" : "xTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2011-09-01T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 16, "screen" : 9.5, "cpu" : 3.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "black", "purple" ], "storage" : [ 128, 256, 512 ] },
            { "_id" : 3, "name" : "SmartTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2015-01-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 12, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 3.66 }, "color" : [ "blue" ], "storage" : [ 16, 64, 128 ] },
            { "_id" : 4, "name" : "SmartPad", "price" : 699, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2020-05-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 8, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "orange", "gold", "gray" ], "storage" : [ 128, 256, 1024 ] },
            { "_id" : 5, "name" : "SmartPhone", "price" : 599, "releaseDate" : ISODate("2022-09-14T00:00:00Z"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 }, "color" : [ "white", "orange", "gold", "gray" ], "storage" : [ 128, 256 ] },
            { "_id" : 6, "name" : "xWidget", "spec" : { "ram" : 64, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 3.66 }, "color" : [ "black" ], "storage" : [ 1024 ] }
        ])

        The following example uses the $nor operator to select documents from the products collection:
        
            db.products.find({
                $nor :[
                    { price: 899},
                    { color: "gold"}
                ]
            }, {
                name: 1,
                price: 1, 
                color: 1
            })

        It returns documents where:
            > the value is the price field is not 899
            > and the color array does not have any "gold" element.
            
        including the documents that do not contains these fields.
        
        It returned the followig documents:
        
            { "_id" : 1, "name" : "xPhone", "price" : 799, "color" : [ "white", "black" ] }
            { "_id" : 6, "name" : "xWidget", "color" : [ "black" ] }



    Summary
        Use the MongodB $nor operator to perform a logical NOR operation on a list of query expressions and select 
        documents that fail all the query expressions.

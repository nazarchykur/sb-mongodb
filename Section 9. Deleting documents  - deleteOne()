MongoDB deleteOne


    Summary: 
        in this tutorial, you’ll learn how to use the MongoDB deleteOne() method to delete a single document from a collection.
    
    
    
    Introduction to the MongoDB deleteOn() method
        The deleteOne() method allows you to delete a single document from a collection.
        
        The deleteOne() method has the following syntax:
        
            db.collection.deleteOne(filter, option)
            
        The deleteOne() method accepts two arguments:
        > filter is an required argument. The filter is a document that specifies the condition for matching the document 
            to remove. If you pass an empty document {} into the method, it’ll delete the first document in the collection.
        > option is an optional argument. The option is a document that specifies the deletion options.
        
        The deleteOne() method returns a document containing the deleteCount field that stores the number of deleted documents.
        
        To delete all documents that match a condition from a collection, you use the deleteMany() method.
        
        
        
    MongoDB deleteCount() method examples
        We’ll use the following products collection:
        
        db.products.insertMany([
            { "_id" : 1, "name" : "xPhone", "price" : 799, "releaseDate": ISODate("2011-05-14"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 6.5, "cpu" : 2.66 },"color":["white","black"],"storage":[64,128,256]},
            { "_id" : 2, "name" : "xTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate": ISODate("2011-09-01") , "spec" : { "ram" : 16, "screen" : 9.5, "cpu" : 3.66 },"color":["white","black","purple"],"storage":[128,256,512]},
            { "_id" : 3, "name" : "SmartTablet", "price" : 899, "releaseDate": ISODate("2015-01-14"), "spec" : { "ram" : 12, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 3.66 },"color":["blue"],"storage":[16,64,128]},
            { "_id" : 4, "name" : "SmartPad", "price" : 699, "releaseDate": ISODate("2020-05-14"),"spec" : { "ram" : 8, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 },"color":["white","orange","gold","gray"],"storage":[128,256,1024]},
            { "_id" : 5, "name" : "SmartPhone", "price" : 599,"releaseDate": ISODate("2022-09-14"), "spec" : { "ram" : 4, "screen" : 9.7, "cpu" : 1.66 },"color":["white","orange","gold","gray"],"storage":[128,256]}
         ])



    1) Using the deleteOne() method to delete a single document
        The following example uses the deleteOne() method to delete a document with the _id is 1 from the products collection:
        
            db.products.deleteOne({ _id: 1 })

        The query returned the following document:
        
            { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 }

        The deleteCount field returned 1 indicating the number of deleted documents.
        
        
        
    2) Using the deleteOne() method to delete the first document from a collection
        The following query uses the deleteOne() method to remove the first document returned from the products collection:
        
            db.products.deleteOne({})

        It returned the following document:
        
            { "acknowledged" : true, "deletedCount" : 1 }

        In this example, we passed an empty document {} to the deleteOne() method. Therefore, it removed the first 
        document from the products collection.
    
    
    
    Summary
        > Use the MongoDB deleteOne() method to remove a single document that matches a condition.
        > Pass an empty document into the deleteOne() method to delete the first document from the collection.
